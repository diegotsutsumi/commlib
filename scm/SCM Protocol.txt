SCM Protocol

| SCM Key | Peer Type | Peer Id | Command | Payload Len | Payload |

SCM Key (4 bytes) = 0x1A 0x8B 0xA7 0x12

Peer Type (1 byte) = Type of Sender 0x1 for Server, 0x2 for Snitch

Peer Id (8 bytes) = Id of Sender Snitch/Server serial number

Command (1 byte) = 
			{
				Register -> 1
				Heart Beat -> 2
				Route -> 3
				SyncListen -> 4
				SyncDelete -> 5
				Ack -> 6
				Nack -> 7
			}
Channel (1 byte) = Channel to be routed

Payload Len (8 bytes) = Length of the following payload

Payload (n bytes defined previously in Payload Len) = Generally http/https messages exchanging by 2 web servers.





Link Layer:
- All Commands (but "Route") that aren't acks should be Acked.

- From the server side, if a snitch previously sent a "Start Routing" all trafic without "SCM Key" at first will be routed to Apache.

- The field 'channel' will be used just along with "Route" and "Sync" Command.

- SyncListen tells which channel the sender is waiting for connections, the other side should listen any other channel.

- SyncDelete tells a channel should be deleted because it was deleted on the other side.
